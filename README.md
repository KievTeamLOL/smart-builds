<ol type="1">
<li> <a href="https://java.com/download"> Java VM </a></li> 
<li> <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat Server</a> (<a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/setup.html">How to setup?</a>)</li>

<li> <b> For run application:</b></li> 
<ol type="1">

<li> Copy WAR file to TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/. <br>
	<i>The value of TOMCAT_HOME will depend on where you have Tomcat
installed.  It should be the root directory of your installation (i.e.
right above bin, conf, etc).
<br>
There are a number of ways to set TOMCAT_HOME.  One is to just set it in
your shell: export TOMCAT_HOME=/usr/share/tomcat.  Another is to add
this line to $CCM_HOME/conf/envvars: TOMCAT_HOME=/usr/share/tomcat

<h3>ABOUT</h3>
<p>Smart Builds is project for easy creating and installing in-game builds. Under builds we understand complex of items, which you need to buy one by one in game to be succeed. We want to alert you that you might will find some bugs or unfinished parts of this site, but we will try to improve it later, in a free from work/study time, because both of programmers are totally exhausted right now. We believe that in future project will be finished and will be commercially valuable.
<p>Everyone can enter the project through registration and add new, unique build. Also, everyone can download builds and install them directly into game client to use them in in-game shop without browser in the background.
<p>Project Smart Builds was created and supported by two independent developers. It was brainstormed in five days and will be completely finished a bit later, to become competitive with other similar sites. All images or data was taken officionally from Riot Games inc. through Riot API and community arts.
<p>Independent developers are: <br>
Java, MySQL - Server side prorammer - Doroshenko Tatiana - EUW - SgrStarr<br>
HTML, JavaScript - User side programmer - Petrushevskyi Alexander - RU - Levelleor
